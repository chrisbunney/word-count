# word-count (Rust)
This is a very simple implementation of the `wc` word count Linux utility in written in **Rust**.

It is inspired by the Rust development videos by [Code Maven](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsgaBYSAcia5op2Umer-9g)

It is part of my personal journey towards mastering Rust and is no way meant to be a replaement for the original `wc` command! ðŸ˜€
